As it stands this site is abominably slow, both to develop and to visit. This
won't do.

Next.js offers an appealing blend of performance enhancing features, focusing
on pre-rendering and static delivery wherever possible, while retaining the
dynamic capabilities of React proper. So far this site is utterly static,
but I anticipate developing some more interactive pieces, so the framework I
choose must accommodate both dynamic and static pages.

What is worth keeping here? I may go for a full revision, tuned for speed.

Edit: after a hefty round of performance tuning, Jekyll works fine for these purposes. For an example of a really snappy Next.js blob, check out the prototype I tossed together at [Easeness.business](https://easeness.business).
